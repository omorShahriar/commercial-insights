          Traditionally, organizations are organized by functions. Every current
          organizational learning platform is designed to be function-oriented
          and vertically aligned. So there are jobs, and there are employees.
          Employee competencies are only measured across positions. Through
          these functions, organizations seek to achieve the business outcomes
          that shareholders desire. In reality, organizations operate based on
          processes that have already been defined by industry groups, which
          have a vested interest in process effectiveness. Businesses analyze
          these processes to measure progress.

          Business processes in all industries are highly similar and not
          bespoke and based on generally agreed result areas and competencies
          from performing a sale, onboarding a new employee, shipping out a
          product, and designing new products to acquire new customers.
          Therefore, the business processes are the right starting point because
          even in the face of automation and change, the required results do not
          change or change very slowly. The same methodology applies to
          processes in essentially any industry. A related benefit results from
          the marginalizing of common areas of business conflict, such as
          gender, age, religion, ethnicity etc.

          We have to agree to focus on the competencies required by the
          professional world. For the last four decades, unemployment agencies
          have been playing catch-up as old competencies are replaced by new
          ones, often in such a rapid succession that today we can’t keep up
          with pace of change. Agencies need to adopt systems that train
          students for problems that we don’t even know exist using technologies
          that have not yet been invented. Tall order? Ten years ago, such a
          system would have been a fantasy, but data mining combined with AI
          gives us the ability to find relationships in data that would take
          teams of traditional statistician’s years to figure out without
          applied machine learning.

            Training is meant to enable learning and development, which often
            happens at the intersection of functions and processes. Within the
            idiosyncrasies of companies, employees end up taking part in many
            different functions and processes not part of their position’s
            traditional job description. This is how businesses operate.
            Business processes in all industries are highly similar. Businesses
            built their training along generally agreed result areas and
            competencies.
